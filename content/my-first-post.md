# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post using the new markdown-based content system! Now I can easily add new blog posts by simply creating markdown files in the `/content` folder.

## What's New

With this new system, you can:

- Add new posts by creating `.md` files in the content folder
- Use frontmatter metadata for titles, dates, tags, and authors
- Write in pure markdown with full syntax support
- Enjoy a modern, sleek design

## How to Add a New Post

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `/content` folder
2. Add frontmatter at the top with metadata
3. Write your content in markdown below the frontmatter
4. The blog will automatically pick it up!

## Example Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
excerpt: A brief description of your post
date: 2024-01-20
tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
author: Your Name
---
```

That's it! The blog will handle the rest automatically.

> Pro tip: Use descriptive filenames for your markdown files, as they become the URL slug for your posts.

Happy blogging! ðŸŽ‰
