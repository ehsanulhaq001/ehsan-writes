# Getting Started with Terminal Blogging

Welcome to your new minimal blog! This post will guide you through the basics of creating and managing content.

## Writing Posts

Posts are written in markdown format with frontmatter metadata. Here's what you can do:

### Formatting

You can use **bold text**, _italic text_, and `inline code`.

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, terminal world!");
}
```

### Lists

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

1. Numbered item
2. Another numbered item

### Links and Images

[Visit GitHub](https://github.com)

> This is a blockquote. Perfect for highlighting important information.

## Tags and Search

Use tags in your frontmatter to categorize posts. The blog supports full-text search and tag filtering.

Happy blogging!
