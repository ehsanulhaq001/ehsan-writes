# Terminal Productivity Tips

The terminal is a developer's best friend. Here are some tips to maximize your efficiency.

## Essential Commands

### File Navigation

```bash
# Quick directory navigation
cd -        # Go to previous directory
cd ~        # Go to home directory
cd ../..    # Go up two directories
```

### File Operations

```bash
# Find files quickly
find . -name "*.js" -type f
grep -r "function" src/

# Quick file editing
vim +10 file.js  # Open file at line 10
```

## Aliases for Speed

Set up these aliases in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias ll="ls -la"
alias ..="cd .."
alias grep="grep --color=auto"
```

## Pro Tips

1. Use tab completion extensively
2. Learn your shell's history search (`Ctrl+R`)
3. Master pipe operations
4. Use screen or tmux for session management

> Remember: The best productivity tool is the one you use consistently.

Keep practicing, and these commands will become second nature!
